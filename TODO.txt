break on all jump table entrypoints, figure them all out (end of level 2!!)

- nb pigs taken 2, but does that increase when a wolf passes
- victory wolves: tile should be symmetric (use runtime symmetry like in elevator action)
- rock kills player: player keeps on falling and falling
- end of level 2: boss stays on the ground
- crash on game over HH and back-trace
- wolves should be HW sprites if possible
- continue to rip sounds & music
- during tutorial, one character is off before "400"
- demo: wrong timing/data (? but still seems coherent)
- capture screenshot memory dumps to filter out unused tiles/cluts
  to save A LOT OF memory
- meat seems to miss wolves at times
- level 2 music becomes more dramatic when wolves are about to push rock
