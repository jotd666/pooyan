figure out DSW 8807 882F

break on all jump table entrypoints, figure them all out

- balloon shot with arrow: first time wolf goes down: balloon/collision not working
  and then randomly works or does not work (but first time NEVER works)
  and when balloon is burst by arrow, the arrow continues!
  => debugging with 1 wolf at a time on MAME
- reverse all wolf_structure_array_8AE0 loops
- double buffering: coded but not working! seems that background restore makes
  sprites disappear???
- osd_w_videoram with low address 8000-83FF doesn't trigger error
- after a while wolves not descending (after a wolf descended on hard left)
- same after life resumes (leave one wolf to kill or cheat key to die)
- nb wolfs flag color should be cyan at start, not red: 8324 should be 8B
- rip sounds & music
- capture screenshot memory dumps to filter out unused tiles/cluts
  to save A LOT OF memory
- still 4 wolves when skipping intro: diff memory with and without intro when game starts
- demo: wrong timing/data
- cheat no wolves on ladder/stone not advancing
