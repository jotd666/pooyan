minor
- round 3: drum music not played on level completion
- sfx on channels 1 & 3 instead of 2 & 3
- sfx in sync with highscore music using E8 command:
_mt_E8Trigger
This byte reflects the value of the last E8 command.
It is reset to 0 after _mt_init. 

- level 2 music should become more "dramatic" when wolves are about to push rock: debug on MAME
- maybe use hw sprites would allow 50Hz... or chained blitter routine?
- test command line (non-whdload)

turn off sfx: bpset E8F,A!=$15 && A!=$16,{PC=$79E8;g}
