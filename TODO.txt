break on all jump table entrypoints, figure them all out

- crash on game over (illegal) in highscore screen
- baloon not positioned properly vs wolf, too low, too to the right
- baloon shot with arrow: wolf not falling (looks ok with meat)
- after a while wolves not descending (after a wolf descended on hard left)
- still 4 wolves when skipping intro
- nb wolfs flag color should be cyan at start, not red: 8324 should be 8B
- implement flipped bobs!
- fix to have just 1 wolf at a time, easier debug!
- double buffering
- capture screenshot memory dumps to filter out unused tiles/cluts
  to save A LOT OF memory
