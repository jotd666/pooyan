figure out DSW 8807 882F

break on all jump table entrypoints, figure them all out

- double buffering: coded but not working! seems that background restore makes
  sprites disappear???
- rock-pushing wolves: leftmost wolf tile not cleared
- sometimes wolf seem to be invincible blocking all attacks (level 1)
- meat seems to miss wolves at times
- end of level 2: boss stays on the ground
- crash on game over HH and back-trace
- rip sounds & music
- cheat key one wolf
- still 4 wolves when skipping intro: diff memory with and without intro when game starts
- demo: wrong timing/data
- push fire=> adds credit even in-game
- capture screenshot memory dumps to filter out unused tiles/cluts
  to save A LOT OF memory
