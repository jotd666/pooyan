- nb wolfs flag color should be cyan at start, not red: 8324 should be 8B
- flipped bobs!
- fix to have just 1 wolf
- remaining protection? 3 wolves on ladders right from start
- wire not properly drawn / basket too
- wolves falling missing sprites/buggy sprites
- unregistered tiles or sprites 29/8, 1A/8, 16/9, 39/5 all look bogus
- double buffering
- capture screenshot memory dumps to filter out unused tiles/cluts
  to save A LOT OF memory
