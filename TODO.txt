figure out DSW 8807 882F

break on all jump table entrypoints, figure them all out

- reverse all wolf_structure_array_8AE0 loops
- double buffering: coded but not working! seems that background restore makes
  sprites disappear???
- osd_w_videoram with low address 8000-83FF doesn't trigger error
- end of level 2: boss stays on the ground
- nb wolfs flag color should be cyan at start, not red: 8324 should be 8B
- rip sounds & music
- capture screenshot memory dumps to filter out unused tiles/cluts
  to save A LOT OF memory
- still 4 wolves when skipping intro: diff memory with and without intro when game starts
- demo: wrong timing/data


converter: lf address >= 0xFC00 consider as negative data
converter: postproc: 	move.b	d0,(ax) and addq.w #1,ax => (ax)+
converter: postproc: 	subq.w #1,ax and move.b d0,(ax) => -(ax)
converter: create dummy LOAD_D1D2_FROM_D1_16 macros
