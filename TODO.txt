- level 2: at some point no collision detection, no more ability to shoot arrows (could it be a missed checksum???)
- level 1: wolf climbs ladder: wrong chars, impossible to shoot (could it be a missed checksum???)
- level 1: no wolf on ladder when a wolf passes/wolves on ladder animation lock up (could it be a missed checksum???)
- crash on game over if high score: check .whdlregister!
- wolves should be HW sprites if possible
- meat doesn't hit balloons
- continue to rip sounds & music
- during tutorial, one character is off before "400"
- demo: wrong timing/data (? but still seems coherent)
- capture screenshot memory dumps to filter out unused tiles/cluts
  to save A LOT OF memory
- level 2 music becomes more dramatic when wolves are about to push rock
