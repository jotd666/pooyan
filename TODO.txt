break on all jump table entrypoints, figure them all out

- 41 pigs taken!!
- rock-pushing wolves: leftmost wolf tile not cleared:
  to test (now: crashing when wolf pushes: who calls 26bc ??? on amiga it crashes)
- add cheat keys whd menu
- meat seems to miss wolves at times
- end of level 2: boss stays on the ground
- crash on game over HH and back-trace
- wolves should be HW sprites if possible
- sound doesn't work properly
- continue to rip sounds & music
- during tutorial, one character is off before "400"
- demo: wrong timing/data (? but still seems coherent)
- capture screenshot memory dumps to filter out unused tiles/cluts
  to save A LOT OF memory
