- identify/rip sounds 9,D,E,F,14,18
- do a 25FPS version for 68000
- suzannah plays on round 2, nothing plays on round 4
- round 3: drum music not played on level completion
- strange sounds issued
- ask no9 to normalize more faint sounds
- maybe remove wolf loop fall sound, cuts off the music
- rip highscore music & identify index
- HW sprites for mama+basket, meat and arrows, using standard "allocate sprite" method
- up the volume of some sounds: check with no9, send the missing/low level sounds
- highscore save: to test!!

minor

- during tutorial, one character is off before "400"
- level 2 music should become more "dramatic" when wolves are about to push rock
- push start button: parasite chars between "PTS" strings sometimes
- capture screenshot memory dumps to filter out unused tiles/cluts
  to save memory

maybe fixed:

converter: don't warn about flags on ld with i or r as target
converter: lf address >= 0xFC00 consider as negative data
converter: postproc: 	move.b	d0,(ax) and addq.w #1,ax => (ax)+
converter: postproc: 	subq.w #1,ax and move.b d0,(ax) => -(ax)
converter: create dummy LOAD_D1D2_FROM_D1_16 macros
