- insert coin adds 31 credits or 2...
- identify/rip sounds 2,3,6,7,8,9,D,E,F,10,13,14,18
- is_bonus_stage_8F50: probably just "is_real_play_8F50" ???
- meat doesn't hit balloons: debug arcade see what causes wolf fall with meat when aiming balloon
- sfx/music completely off after first game!!!! queuing sounds????
- missing clut (second bonus stage): C3,1 19,C 4,8: to test
- level 2 completed tune not playing
- do a 25FPS version for 68000

- wolves should be HW sprites if possible, so should be piglets (priority!!)
- continue to rip sounds: missing wolf falling sound + crash
- continue to rip sounds: missing fruit shot sound
- hit: fall sound should not end with crash sound, should be separated: rip when falling from very high
- highscore save

minor

- during tutorial, one character is off before "400"
- level 2 music should become more "dramatic" when wolves are about to push rock
- push start button: parasite chars between "PTS" strings sometimes
- insert coin: awards 2 credits immediately
- capture screenshot memory dumps to filter out unused tiles/cluts
  to save memory

maybe fixed:

- level 2: at some point no collision detection, no more ability to shoot arrows (could it be a missed checksum???)
- level 1: wolf climbs ladder: wrong chars, impossible to shoot (could it be a missed checksum???)
- level 1: no wolf on ladder when a wolf passes/wolves on ladder animation lock up (could it be a missed checksum???)
