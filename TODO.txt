- do a 25FPS version for 68000
- wolves should be HW sprites if possible
- meat doesn't hit balloons
- continue to rip sounds
- install no9 music & sounds
- push start button: parasite chars between "PTS" strings
- hit: fall sound should not end with crash sound, should be separated
- highscore save
- during tutorial, one character is off before "400"
- capture screenshot memory dumps to filter out unused tiles/cluts
  to save A LOT OF memory
- level 2 music becomes more dramatic when wolves are about to push rock
- TBC: level 2: at some point no collision detection, no more ability to shoot arrows (could it be a missed checksum???)
- TBC: level 1: wolf climbs ladder: wrong chars, impossible to shoot (could it be a missed checksum???)
- TBC: level 1: no wolf on ladder when a wolf passes/wolves on ladder animation lock up (could it be a missed checksum???)
