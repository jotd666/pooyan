break on all jump table entrypoints, figure them all out

- update_88A0_0038: sound??
- balloon shot with arrow: wolf not falling (looks ok with meat)
  => debugging with 1 wolf at a time on MAME
- reverse all wolf_structure_array_8AE0 loops
- double buffering: coded but not working! seems that background restore makes
  sprites disappear???
- after a while wolves not descending (after a wolf descended on hard left)
- same after life resumes (leave one wolf to kill or cheat key to die)
- nb wolfs flag color should be cyan at start, not red: 8324 should be 8B
- add trainer infinite lives + invincible
- rip sounds & music
- capture screenshot memory dumps to filter out unused tiles/cluts
  to save A LOT OF memory
- still 4 wolves when skipping intro
- demo: wrong timing/data
