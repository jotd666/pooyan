- meat doesn't hit balloons
- do a 25FPS version for 68000
- insert coin: should stop intro music
- wolves should be HW sprites if possible, so should be piglets (priority!!)
- continue to rip sounds: missing meat taken
- install no9 music & sounds: looped should be stopped by new music play, music should stop on level end
- hit: fall sound should not end with crash sound, should be separated: rip when falling from very high
- highscore save
- during tutorial, one character is off before "400"
- level 2 music becomes more dramatic when wolves are about to push rock
- push start button: parasite chars between "PTS" strings sometimes
- TBC: level 2: at some point no collision detection, no more ability to shoot arrows (could it be a missed checksum???)
- TBC: level 1: wolf climbs ladder: wrong chars, impossible to shoot (could it be a missed checksum???)
- TBC: level 1: no wolf on ladder when a wolf passes/wolves on ladder animation lock up (could it be a missed checksum???)
- capture screenshot memory dumps to filter out unused tiles/cluts
  to save A LOT OF memory
