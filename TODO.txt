- identify/rip sounds 9,D,E,F,14,18
- do a 25FPS version for 68000
- suzannah plays on round 2, nothing plays on round 4
- round 3: drum music not played on level completion
- strange sounds issued
- ask no9 to normalize more faint sounds

- wolves should be HW sprites if possible, so should be piglets (priority!!)
- continue to rip sounds: missing wolf falling sound + crash
- continue to rip sounds: missing fruit shot sound
- up the volume of some sounds: check with no9, send the missing/low level sounds
- highscore save

minor

- during tutorial, one character is off before "400"
- level 2 music should become more "dramatic" when wolves are about to push rock
- push start button: parasite chars between "PTS" strings sometimes
- insert coin: awards 2 credits immediately
- capture screenshot memory dumps to filter out unused tiles/cluts
  to save memory

maybe fixed:

- level 2: at some point no collision detection, no more ability to shoot arrows (could it be a missed checksum???)
- level 1: wolf climbs ladder: wrong chars, impossible to shoot (could it be a missed checksum???)
- level 1: no wolf on ladder when a wolf passes/wolves on ladder animation lock up (could it be a missed checksum???)
