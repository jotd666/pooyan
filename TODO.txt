- round 3: drum music not played on level completion
- sometimes starts with credits=30 and score=13!!!
- wolf on ladder: sometimes "0" character on top right!
- push start: $8496 written with "4"!!!
- during tutorial, one character is off before "400"
- level 2 music should become more "dramatic" when wolves are about to push rock


turn off sfx: bpset E8F,A!=$15 && A!=$16,{PC=$79E8;g}

maybe fixed:

converter: don't warn about flags on ld with i or r as target
converter: lf address >= 0xFC00 consider as negative data
converter: postproc: 	move.b	d0,(ax) and addq.w #1,ax => (ax)+
converter: postproc: 	subq.w #1,ax and move.b d0,(ax) => -(ax)
converter: create dummy LOAD_D1D2_FROM_D1_16 macros
