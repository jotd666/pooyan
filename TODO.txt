break on all jump table entrypoints, figure them all out

- now only 3 wolves on ladder, debug nb on ladder in wolf_reaches_ladder_2d80
- rock-pushing wolves: leftmost wolf tile not cleared: to test (now: crashing when wolf pushes)
- add cheat keys whd menu
- sometimes wolf seem to be invincible blocking all attacks (level 1): if high attack blocked
  once (by balloon shield), then arrow bounces on balloon even if shield not up.
- meat seems to miss wolves at times
- end of level 2: boss stays on the ground
- crash on game over HH and back-trace
- wolves should be HW sprites if possible
- sound doesn't work properly beside credit play
- continue to rip sounds & music
- during tutorial, one character is off before "400"
- demo: wrong timing/data (? but still seems coherent)
- capture screenshot memory dumps to filter out unused tiles/cluts
  to save A LOT OF memory
